# Drop Project Plugin for Intellij Idea with GPT support

This is an extension of the Drop Project Student plugin for Intellij IDEA which adds GPT-related functionality. It aims at improving student support when dealing with auto-graded assignments, and it was developed with input from both CS teachers and students and aims.

More concretely, the following functionality was added to the original (v9.3.0) plugin:
* The build/submission report now displays an "Ask GPT" button for each error reported by the Drop Project AAT;
* Chat-based interface, similar to ChatGPT / Gemin;
* Capacity to simultaneously ask for 2 solutions and compare them using a Git diff-like interface;
* Interaction logs are created locally (not sent to any server);
* Students can vote on wether GPT's reply was useful or not (this information is logged locally and can be explored for research purposes);

This will soon be integrated in the official GitHub repository and in the IntelliJ IDEA store.
